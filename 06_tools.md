# Tools

Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible).

## Code HS
* Purpose: To give videos, articles, exploratory activities, and assignments to students. It can also collect work, provide a sandbox to code in, and provide a space for teachers to give feedback.
* Class: 7th grade Web Development
* How it's used: I don't use all of CodeHS's features since I think it's a bit clunky. However, I use it for inspiration on assignments/tasks for the students, and overall content and curriculum of the Web Development course. (I use a few other resources too, but I mainly follow CodeHS' curriculum). I will make an assignment and post resources in the same lesson, and students will code it all on CodeHS. 
* Why select this tool for this purpose? I particularly chose CodeHS instead of just Replit because it has a block-based coding feature for HTML. I thought this would be a great scaffold for my 7th graders, who learned on Scratch last year. I didn't want to intimidate or cut off accessibility. Unfortunately, I am finding that their blocks are also kind of clunky, and we end up switching to Code View (text-based view) anyways. I think it was still valuable to start off with the block-based coding, but it's still not 100% the greatest thing ever.

## Google Classroom Rubrics
* Purpose: Make grading easier, streamlined, and provide feedback
* Class: 10th grade Web Development
* How it's used: Students will post their Replit assignment on their corresponding Google Classroom assignment. I create a detailed rubric that has the criteria for success listed out and the various levels of mastery (along with point allotment and specific descriptions for each level) on the rubric. When I go to Google Classroom, I can click to easily open their work and then grade their work directly on Google Classroom. Students can see how exactly I graded their work, and what areas they did well in and what they can improve on. Because of the Private Comment section, I can also drop them a note on how they did, questions I have for them, things I want to think about, or hints on mistakes they made.
* Why select this tool? It's great that every classroom basically has their own Google Classroom now. Everyone is on it, they all have the app, they know how to use it, it's aesthetic, very good UX, and easy to edit. The only bad part is once you start grading on that rubric, you can't edit the rubric.
