* Come up with an idea for a new computer science course that you would teach at your current school.

Mobile Apps
Anyone who has a tablet or smart phone uses mobile apps. These are arguably just as, if not more, valuable than webpages. Apps can be useful tools for functioning in our society. Students will learn the React Native framework and its structure and syntax in order to recreate popular apps and make their own app. It also serves as a great outlet to solve real world issues in their community.

Target audience: 11th / 12th grade
CS Sequence: An advanced CS course, requires prior CS experience (JavaScript and WebDev)
