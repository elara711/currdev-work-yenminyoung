* Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.
* You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both, or different ones.

Impacts of Computing --> Society --> 9-12.IC.1
Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.

A popular topic I like to bring up is facial recognition and how it is less accurate with darker skin and for females. We watch the documentary "Coded Bias" which dives into the technology and implications of the facial recognition software. It could accurately identify a singlar demographic very well, (coined the "White Male Gaze"), which reflected the demographic that it was created by. This can have many different effects, ranging from annoyingly inconvenient (sensors don't sense hands at the sink, or Snapchat filters being inconsistent) to nefarious (CIA misidentifying Black citizens for crimes). In the documentary, they advocate for more female and BIPOC representation in CS so that technology that is prevalent throughout society will benefit *all* types of people. We also read an article about how the first beauty contest judged by AI produces heavily biased results, which, unsurprisingly, voted lighter skin models as more beautiful.


Cybersecurity --> Safeguards --> 9-12.CY.4
Evaluate applications of cryptographic methods.

Initially, we study the Caesar Cipher to understand the concept of decryption, encryption, methodology, and a key. Then we study other types of cyphers (Bacon, Book, Railroad, etc.) and how they are applied differently. I created a Breakout Box (similar to Escape the Room) involving 6 different types of cyphers with clues hidden around the room. The students have to figure out which cipher to apply and find the correct keys in order to unlock the boxes.
