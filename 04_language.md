 * Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms (Processing, Scratch/Snap, Netlogo) that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)


In the future, I might teach AP CSP. I heard a lot about the BJC curriculum using Snap, so I am curious to learn more about that.
- Grades 11/12, AP CSP. No CS background required
- Snap
- Block based coding
- It doesn't seem to complex? Though I have never used Snap before
- With block based coding, you don't have to worry about all of the syntax errors of missing ; or } and the like. You also have a library of basic codes that are easy to manipulate (drag and drop) and tweak. This also makes it a lot easier to "mess around" and just experiment and play.
- I am not familiar with the AP CSP course or Snap, so I can't answer this question super deeply. But based on what I know, I think it would make an AP course less intimidating for those who have never coded before, and can focus more on the coding conceps rather than getting bogged down with syntax.
- It is a useful skill to know how to type with syntax
- Maybe have the practice using text-based codes too? Maybe the Snap code can be the scaffold or planning page for the text-based code.
- I chose this language because other people have recommended it.
