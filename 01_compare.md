* Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similiarities
  * Comparative strengths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
  * Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

Last year, I taught a semester-long course of p5.js. I will compare my class with the nycdoe cs4all curriculum (https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/)

We both cover shapes, variables, randomization, RGB, HSB, conditionals, mouse events, key presses, functions, text, images, animation

They cover more than what I do. They incorporate complex shapes (creating your own shape, layering), hovering and clicking. They also cover more complex coding such as arrays, lists, loops, sounds

I think my course tends to focus more on projects and practice so that the students get a more solidifed understanding of the topics. However, we don't get as far. In their course, they quickly go through the curriculum and don't have additional exercises or practice for struggling students.

If I could, I would want to incorporate loops becaue it would be a neat project for students to make a wallpaper (or other trippy) design. I think they would have a lot of fun making something aesthetic like that. Loops are also a really important part of computational thinking that I just didn't have time for.
