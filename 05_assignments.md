## Unit: Intro to Bootstrap

### Assignment #1: Make a slideshow of your family and friends
In this exercise, you will make a carousel of images of your friends and family. 
1. Import the Bootstrap library
2. Go to the Bootstrap website and select which type of carousel you like.
3. Paste in the code template for the carousel into your Replit.
4. Download at least 3 photos of your friends and family into the files of your Replit.
5. Inside each `<img src="...">`, type in the image address of your photos.
6. Can you add more photos? Copy and paste the correct lines of code and repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have at least 10 photos in your slideshow.

### Assignment #2: Build a Travel Blog
You will be building a travel blog that contains at least 3 different components. We recommend using cards, a carousel, and a navbar, though you can choose any of the other components as you wish. You can make it a blog of places you have already been to and where you want to go in the future, OR a company brand that is advertising various destination places. You will have the full week to work on this project with a partner.

* Indicate clearly what type of travel blog you are making and write a brief introduction.
* 3 different components that are fully functional and customized
* At least 3 different countries are listed, with a description, pictures, and links to learn more.
* A color scheme

#### Extra Challenges:
* Add a fourth component
* Incorporate a fourth country into your blog
* Add another page within your Replit that can be linked to from your home page.
